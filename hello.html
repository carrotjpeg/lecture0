<h3>Backstory Of My Birds (Blue)</h3>
Basically I had 5 birds before I got the birds that I have now. But, one of the 5 birds was Blue. Blue was a trained bird and we got from PetCo near my dad's work.
Blue's owner was an elderly person who was retired, I think...And she/he had so much time in the world, and so much patience. This person who trained Blue trained him to cuddle
with you, go on your head, eat anything you fed him, and he could talk! I spent around 2 years with him continually, and then when I started going into 4th grade the work load
increased. Thus, I couldnt spend time with my prescious (dead...) BAbY. He forgot most of his skills by 2018, or my 5th grade year, but the one thing he would do was he would 
always look at me, and come to me. My family had to go to India, which we always do every summer. We give my birds to my aunt and she would take care of him. Anyways if I talk even
more about him I will start to cry-and cry myself a sea. Long story short, my prescious baby died, due to extreme heat. My aunt was so sad, so she bought me two identical birds, but 
she didn't know about the genders. Thus, I could easily tell what happened to my prescious baby, (I had another birdo, but she wasn't as prescious as my Blue), they both died. ;(
I have those two birds with me now, they're both okay. But you can never replace a bird that was kind, and would look to you with compassion! I'm sorry that I couldn't say goodbye
to you blue~
